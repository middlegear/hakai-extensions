rework on the promise functions


implement string similarity under utils and export it not as npm package



in the end add some rankings


there is an issue with meta dates
the filter in jkan should be renamed to something better

both for jikan and amilist

safe limit for both providers  should be 174 episodes otherwise the abort the promise.all and do the indivial providers
 otherwise use each meta episode info under the player

to fetch episode info below the player i can use mal id from the anilist info
